# Blood Cancer Detection System - BCDS 🩸💻
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution to detect cancerous blood cells from images of blood samples. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of blood cell images, classified into cancerous and non-cancerous categories. The goal is to create a reliable tool that can automatically identify cancer cells, assisting medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses. 🩺

## Key Features:
- Image Preprocessing: Resizing and normalizing blood cell images to prepare them for training. 🖼️🔧
- Model Training: Training a CNN to classify blood cells as cancerous or normal. 📚🤖
- Model Inference: Using the trained model to predict whether a given blood cell image is cancerous or normal. 🔍📊
- This deep learning model can perform inference on both TIFF and JPEG blood cell images. The project demonstrates the application of CNNs in medical image classification, with the potential for further improvements and integration into real-world diagnostic systems. 🌍💡
